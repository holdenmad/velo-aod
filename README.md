# Velo AOD PSD Project - WBS Week 1

## Objectives 

1. Choose design to realize
2. Create repo
3. Create master and branches
4. Create classes and ids for 
5. Create grid system according to the PSD file
6. Discuss where sections repeat, and where to use the same classes


## What I Learned

- Make a structure 
- How to make grids with grid-template-areas
- Making background-images on divs while setting the size of them so that they can be responsive
- Using max-width and max-height to make things responsive
- Centering things with margins and position: absolute


## Things to look at (not for now)

- Media queries 


## To Do

1. Fix social media icons, put them in middle
2. If we have time let's make the three dots scroll
3. Fix the 'discover the shop' button


## Notes:

- Madlen read that you use the PSD and measure it
- Site doesn't need width and height (fixed). You can use percentages.
- Use media queries for certain screen sizes
- To make the height smaller, then the pictuer can adjust more (to make sure it doesn't cut it off)
