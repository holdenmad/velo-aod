## Questions

1. What is a good way to center objects like buttons?
2. Have I chosen a good way to make background-images responsive? Is there a better or easier way? 
3. Do I have to make a 'hard' height or width or images in a responsive design, or is there a type of sizing that works well for resopnsive images?

Things to look at:
- Media queries 
- 

## Objectives 

1. Choose design to realize
2. Create repo
3. Create master and branches
4. Create classes and ids for 
5. Create grid system according to the PSD file
6. Discuss where sections repeat, and where to use the same classes


## To Do

1. Try to use grid-template-area, grid-template-rows, and grid-template-columns like Niklas to get the grids working
2. 



classes

3 small text boxes
2 bigger text boxes (possibly with image)
3 small horizontal iamges (saddles)
2 red bike images
4 square images
2 horizontal thicker (shop now and brooks)
2 skinny vertical images
small green icons

6 different sizes of images

white image for overlay

button "discover the shop" 

logo AODX
text with caption stay on the saddle
form email 
go button

footer 
social media icon class
id/class for address?
icon with yebo id

If we have time let's make the three dots scroll


To order CSS:

velo-aod


For overlay, make div with background image
use position: absolute with overlay image

## Notes:
- Madlen read that you use the PSD and measure it
- Site doesn't need width and height (fixed). You can use percentages.
- Use media queries for certain screen sizes
- To make the height smaller, then the pictuer can adjust more (to make sure it doesn't cut it off)
